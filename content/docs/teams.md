# Teams

Teams in Pavrel are a great way for a group of people to share ideas and work together on projects. Within a workspace, you can create as many teams as you like.

## Creating Teams

When you create a new workspace in Pavrel, your first team is created automatically. This is a great place to capture all your ideas in one team if you're just starting out. To create a new team, simply click the 3 dots icon next to the "Teams" heading in the sidebar and select "Create new team". You can also create a new team by going to Settings > Teams > Create new team.

## Joining Teams

To join a public team, click the 3 dots icon next to the "Teams" heading in the sidebar and select "Join teams...". You can also do this from within your workspace settings. If you've been invited to a private team, you'll need to click the link provided by a team member to accept the invitation.

## Managing Teams

### Permissions

When you create a team, you become the Admin of that team, with control over team membership and settings. You can invite people to join the team, remove team members, and customize team settings such as visibility. You can also appoint additional admins to help manage the team. 

In general, team members can:

- Create and edit ideas within the team
- View all ideas and comments within the team
- Add comments to ideas and replies to comments
- Attach files to ideas and comments

As a team admin, you have additional control over who is an admin or a member of the team, as well as the ability to delete the team if necessary.
