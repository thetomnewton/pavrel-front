# Workspaces

A workspace is the central hub for all of your activities in Pavrel. It provides a dedicated space for any group of people to work together, whether it's for your organization, family, or personal projects.

You can join or create multiple workspaces to keep all of your work and collaborations organized.

## Creating or Joining a Workspace

When you sign up for a Pavrel account, you will be prompted to create your first workspace if you were not invited by someone else. You can always rename your workspace and invite more people later.

If you were invited to join a workspace, simply create an account or sign in to your existing account and accept the invitation to immediately gain access.

## Workspace Roles & Permissions

### Workspace Owners

Workspace owners have the highest level of control over a workspace. They can add and remove members, edit the workspace settings, and delete the workspace altogether.

A workspace can have multiple owners, which can be useful for larger teams or as a backup.

To manage the access levels of other members, including adding or removing other owners, navigate to the "Settings" section and select the "Members" tab under "Workspace."

### Workspace Admins

Workspace admins have the ability to add and remove members from the workspace, but only in a "member" role.

They can also edit or delete idea comments made by other members, whereas standard members can only edit or delete their own comments.

### Workspace Members

This is the standard membership role for anyone who wants to create ideas and collaborate in a workspace without any administrative responsibilities.

By using these roles and permissions, you can keep your workspace organized and ensure that the right people have the necessary access and control.
