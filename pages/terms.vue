      FOR A FREE ACCESS PLAN FOR THE SERVICE THROUGH A SCREEN THAT REFERENCES THIS AGREEMENT, OR (C) CLICKING A BOX
      INDICATING ACCEPTANCE, CUSTOMER AGREES TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE INDIVIDUAL ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT DOES SO ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY (“Customer”); SUCH
      INDIVIDUAL REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY TO THIS AGREEMENT. IF THE
      INDIVIDUAL ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR THE APPLICABLE ENTITY DOES NOT AGREE WITH
      THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, SUCH INDIVIDUAL MUST NOT ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT AND MAY NOT USE OR RECEIVE THE SERVICE.
      CAPITALIZED TERMS HAVE THE DEFINITIONS SET FORTH HEREIN. THE PARTIES AGREE AS FOLLOWS:
    </p>
    <p><strong>1. The Service.</strong></p>
    <p>
      1.1. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Service Description</span>. Pavrel is the owner and provider of a
      cloud-based software for product teams (the “<strong>Service</strong>”). Anything Customer (including Users)
      posts, uploads, shares, stores, or otherwise provide through the Service is considered a “<strong
        >User Submission</strong
      >.” Customer is solely responsible for all User Submissions it contributes to the Service. Further terms regarding
      User Submissions, including ownership, are in Section 8.2 below. The Service may also include templates, help
      documents, and other documents or information that can assist Customer using the Service (“<strong
        >Pavrel Content</strong
      >”). Customer will not receive or have access to the code or software that underlies the Service (collectively the
      “<strong>Software</strong>”) or receive a copy of the Software itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      1.2. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Customer’s Subscription</span>. Subject to the terms of this
      Agreement, Customer may purchase a subscription to, and has the right to access and use, the Service as specified
      in one or more ordering screens agreed to by the parties through Pavrel’s website that reference this Agreement
      and describe the business terms related to Customer’s subscription (“<strong>Order(s)</strong>”). All
      subscriptions will be for the period described on the applicable Order (“<strong>Subscription Period</strong>”).
      Use of and access to the Service is permitted only by individuals authorized by Customer and for Customer’s own
      internal business purposes and not for the benefit of any third party (“<strong>Users</strong>”).
    </p>
    <p>
      1.3. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Pavrel’s Ownership</span>. Pavrel owns the Service, Software, Pavrel
      Content, Documentation, and anything else provided by Pavrel to Customer (collectively the “<strong
        >Pavrel Materials</strong
      >”). Pavrel retains all right, title and interest (including, without limitation, all patent, copyright,
      trademarks, trade secret and other intellectual property rights) in and to the Pavrel Materials, all related and
      underlying technology and any updates, enhancements, upgrades, modifications, patches, workarounds, and fixes
      thereto and all derivative works of or modifications to any of the foregoing. There are no implied licenses under
      this Agreement and any rights not expressly granted to Customer in this Agreement are expressly reserved by
      Pavrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      1.4. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Permissions</span>. The Service contains customizable settings
      allowing each User to give permission to other Users to perform various tasks within the Service
      (“<strong>Permissions</strong>”). It is also solely Customer’s responsibility to set and manage all Permissions,
      including which Users can set such Permissions. Accordingly, Pavrel will have no responsibility for managing
      Permissions and no liability for the Permissions set by Customer and its Users. Customer may, at its option,
      provide access to the Service and Documentation to its Affiliates (defined below), in which case all rights
      granted, and obligations incurred, under this Agreement will also inure to the benefit of such Affiliates.
      Customer represents and warrants that it is fully responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its Affiliates
      and that Customer has the power to negotiate this Agreement on behalf of its Affiliates. Customer will also be
      responsible for all payment obligations under this Agreement regardless of whether the use of the Service is by
      Customer or its Affiliates. Any claim by an Affiliate against Pavrel will be brought by Customer and not the
      Affiliate. For the purposes of this Agreement “Affiliate” will mean of a party will mean an entity directly or
      indirectly controlling, controlled by or under common control with that party (where “control” means the ownership
      or control, directly or indirectly, of more than fifty percent (50%) of all the voting power of the shares (or
      other securities or rights) entitled to vote for the election of directors or other governing authority.
    </p>
    <p><strong>2. Restrictions.&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>
      2.1. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Customer’s Responsibilities</span>. Customer is responsible for all
      activity on its Users’ accounts unless such activity is caused by a third party bad actor able to access
      Customer’s account by exploiting vulnerabilities in the Service itself. Customer will ensure that its Users are
      aware of and bound by obligations and/or restrictions stated in this Agreement and Customer will be responsible
      for breach of any such obligation and/or restriction by a User.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.2. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Use Restrictions</span>. Customer agrees that it will not, and will
      not allow Users or third parties to, directly or indirectly (a) modify, translate, copy or create derivative works
      based on the Service, (b) reverse assemble, reverse compile, reverse engineer, decompile or otherwise attempt to
      discover the object code, source code, non-public APIs or underlying ideas or algorithms of the Service, except as
      and only to the extent this restriction is prohibited by law, (c) license, sublicense, sell, resell, rent, lease,
      transfer, assign, distribute, time share or otherwise commercially exploit or make the Service available to any
      third party, other than Authorized Customers, (d) remove or obscure any copyright, trademark or other proprietary
      notices, legends or Pavrel branding contained in or on the Service, (e) use the Service in any way that violates
      any applicable federal, state, local or international law or regulation, (f) attempt to gain unauthorized access
      to, interfere with, damage or disrupt any parts of the Service, including, without limitation, by introducing
      viruses and other harmful code or by using flood pings, denial-of-service attacks, or similar methods or
      technology, (g) use or access the Service to build or support and/or assist a third party in building or
      supporting products or services competitive to the Service or (h) attempt to probe, scan, or test the
      vulnerability of the Service or any Pavrel system or networks. If Customer (including Users) is using the Service
      in a manner that, in Pavrel’s reasonable judgment, causes or is likely to cause significant harm to Pavrel or the
      Service or otherwise threatens the security, integrity or availability of the Service then Pavrel may suspend
      Customer’s access to the Service. Pavrel will use commercially reasonable efforts under the circumstances of such
      suspension to (x) provide Customer with notice and an opportunity to remedy such violation or threat prior to any
      such suspension; (y) limit the suspension to only accounts involved in the activities in question; and (z) remove
      the suspension as quickly as practicable after the circumstances leading to the suspension have been resolved.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.3. <span style="text-decoration: underline">API Access Restrictions</span>. As part of provision of its Service,
      Pavrel may provide Customer with access to one or more application program interfaces (“<strong>API(s)</strong>”).
      Pavrel may, in its sole discretion, set and enforce limits on Customer’s use of the API and Customer agrees to
      adhere to such limits. Pavrel may also suspend Customer’s access to the API or cease providing the API at any
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. <strong>Third-Party Applications</strong>. The Service may work together with third party products, services or
      applications that are not owned or controlled by Pavrel, (e.g., Github) (“<strong>Third-Party Applications</strong
      >”) and Customer, at its sole option, may choose to use such Third-Party Applications. If necessary for the
      Service and the Third-Party Application to work together, Customer will provide its login information to Pavrel
      for the sole purpose of Pavrel providing the Service to Customer and Customer represents and warrants that
      Customer has the right to provide such login information without breach by Customer of any of the terms and
      conditions that govern Customer’s use of the applicable Third-Party Application. Pavrel does not endorse such
      Third-Party Applications. Customer acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement does not apply to Customer’s use of
      such Third-Party Applications and Customer be required by the providers of such Third-Party Applications to enter
      into separate agreements for Customer’s use.
      <strong
        >Pavrel expressly disclaims all representations and warranties relating to any Third-Party Applications.
        Customer will look solely to the providers of the Third-Party Applications for any warranty related issues or
        other claims. Customer’s use of Third-Party Applications is at Customer’s own risk. Pavrel will have no
        liability or other obligation of any kind arising out of or related to any third-party applications, including
        arising from Customer’s use or inability to use Third-Party Applications.&nbsp;</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p><strong>4. Payment Obligations.</strong></p>
    <p>
      4.1. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Fees</span>. Customer will pay for access to and use of the Service
      as set forth on the applicable Order (“<strong>Fees</strong>”). All Fees will be paid in the currency stated in
      the applicable Order or, if no currency is specified, U.S. dollars. Payment obligations are non-cancelable and,
      except as expressly stated in this Agreement, non-refundable. Pavrel may modify its Fees or introduce new fees in
      its sole discretion. Customer always has the right to choose not to renew its subscription if it does not agree
      with any new or revised Fees.
    </p>
    <p>
      4.2. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Payment</span>. Pavrel, either directly or through its third-party
      payment processor (“<strong>Payment Processor</strong>”) will charge Customer for the Fees via credit card or ACH
      payment, pursuant to the credit card or ACH payment information provided by Customer to Pavrel. Pavrel will have
      the right to charge Customer’s credit card or ACH payment method for any services provided to Customer by
      Pavrel under the Order, including recurring Fees. It is Customer’s sole responsibility to provide Pavrel with
      current and up to date credit card or ACH information; failure to provide such information may result in
      suspension of Customer’s access to the Services. Pavrel will also have the right to set-off any Fees due from
      Customer to Pavrel. If Customer pays the Fees through a Payment Processor such payment processing will be subject
      to the terms, conditions, and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to this Agreement. Pavrel is
      not responsible for any error by, or other acts or omissions of, the Payment Processor. Pavrel reserves the right
      to correct any errors or mistakes that the Payment Processor makes even if Pavrel has already requested or
      received payment.
      <strong
        >If authorized by Customer through acceptance of an Order, recurring charges (e.g. monthly billing) will be
        charged to Customer’s payment instrument without further authorization from Customer, until Customer terminates
        this Agreement in accordance with its terms or changes its payment method in Customer’s account in the
        Service.</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      4.3. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Taxes</span>.&nbsp;Fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or
      similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding
      taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction whatsoever (collectively, “<strong>Taxes</strong>”). Customer is responsible
      for paying all Taxes associated with its purchases hereunder. If Pavrel has the legal obligation to pay or collect
      Taxes for which Customer is responsible under this section, Pavrel will invoice Customer and Customer will pay
      that amount unless Customer provides Pavrel with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate
      taxing authority in advance. For clarity, Pavrel is solely responsible for taxes assessable against it based on
      its income, property, and employees.
    </p>
    <p>
      4.4. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Failure to Pay</span>. If Customer fails to pay any Fees when due,
      Pavrel may suspend Customer’s access to the Service pending payment of such overdue amounts. Customer also
      authorizes Pavrel to re-try charging Customer’s payment instrument up to four (4) times if an initial attempt at
      such charge has not been successful. If Customer believes that Pavrel has billed Customer incorrectly, Customer
      must contact Pavrel no later than sixty (60) days after the closing date on the first billing statement in which
      the error or problem appeared, to receive an adjustment or credit. Once Pavrel receives notice of a disputed
      invoice, Pavrel will review such notice and provide Customer with a written decision regarding the dispute,
      including documentary support for such decision. If Pavrel reasonably determines that the amounts billed are, in
      fact, due, Customer will pay such amounts (if it has not done so already) within ten (10) days of Pavrel notifying
      Customer in writing of such decision.
    </p>
    <p><strong>5. Term and Termination.</strong></p>
    <p>
      5.1. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Agreement Term and Renewals</span>. Subscriptions to access and use
      the Service commence on the start date stated on the applicable Order(“<strong>Subscription Start Date</strong>”)
      and continue for the duration of the Subscription Period. Customer may choose not to renew its Subscription Period
      by notifying Pavrel at billing@Pavrel.app (provided that Pavrel confirms such cancellation in writing) or by
      modifying its subscription through Customer’s account within the Service. This Agreement will become effective on
      the first day of the Subscription Period and remain effective for the duration of the Subscription Period stated
      on the Order along with any renewals of the Subscription Period and any period that Customer is using the Service
      even if such use is not under a paid Order (“Term”). If the parties terminate this Agreement, it will
      automatically terminate all Orders. If Customer cancels or does not renew its paid subscription to the Service,
      Customer’s subscription will be accessible but will automatically be downgraded to a version of the Service with
      diminished features and functionality that Pavrel offers to unpaid subscribers (“Free Version”). If Customer or
      Pavrel terminates this Agreement or Customer deletes its workspace within the Service, Customer will not have
      access to the Free Version.
    </p>
    <p>
      5.2. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Termination</span>. Either party may terminate this Agreement upon
      written notice to the other party if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and such breach is not
      cured within thirty (30) days after the breaching party’s receipt of such notice. Pavrel may terminate Customer’s
      access to the Free Version at any time upon notice to Customer.
    </p>
    <p>
      5.3. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Effect of Termination</span>. If Customer terminates this Agreement
      because of Pavrel’s uncured breach, Pavrel will refund any unused, prepaid Fees for the remainder of the
      then-current Subscription Period. If Pavrel terminates this Agreement because of Customer’s uncured breach,
      Customer will pay any unpaid Fees covering the remainder of the then-current Subscription Period after the
      effective date of termination, if any. In no event will any termination relieve Customer of the obligation to pay
      any Fees payable to Pavrel for the period prior to the effective date of termination. Upon any termination of this
      Agreement, all rights and licenses granted by Pavrel hereunder will immediately terminate; Customer will no longer
      have the right to access or use the Service. Within thirty (30) days of termination of this Agreement for cause,
      upon Customer’s request following termination, or if Customer deletes its workspace within the Service, Pavrel
      will delete Customer’s User Information, including passwords and all related information, files, and User
      Submissions, unless Customer requests an earlier deletion in writing. If Customer is using the Free Version,
      Pavrel will retain User Submissions and User Information to facilitate such use. Pavrel may delete all User
      Submissions or User Information if Customer maintains an account in the Free Version but such account is not
      usedfor a period of one (1) year or more.
    </p>
    <p>
      5.4. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Survival</span>. Sections titled “Pavrel’s Ownership”, “Third-Party
      Applications”, “Payment Obligations”, “Term and Termination”, “Warranty Disclaimer”, “Limitation of Liability”,
      “Confidentiality”, “Data” and “General Terms” will survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.
    </p>
    <p><strong>6. Warranties and Disclaimers</strong>.</p>
    <p>
      6.1. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Warranties</span>. Customer represents and warrants that all User
      Submissions submitted by Users follow all applicable laws, rules and regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      6.2. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Warranty Disclaimer</span>. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR HEREIN,
      THE SERVICES AND ALL RELATED COMPONENTS AND INFORMATION ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS
      WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, AND PAVREL EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR
      IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND
      NON-INFRINGEMENT. CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT PAVREL DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED,
      TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE DISCLAIMER OF CERTAIN TYPES OF WARRANTIES. THE
      FOREGOING DISCLAIMERS WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>7. Limitation of Liability.</strong> NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, PAVREL
      WILL NOT BE LIABLE WITH RESPECT TO ANY CAUSE RELATED TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN AN ACTION
      BASED ON A CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE AND STRICT LIABILITY) OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, HOWEVER ARISING,

      INTERRUPTION, DELAY OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE, LOST REVENUES OR PROFITS, DELAYS, INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF
      SERVICES, BUSINESS OR GOODWILL, LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA, LOSS RESULTING FROM SYSTEM OR SYSTEM SERVICE FAILURE,
      MALFUNCTION OR SHUTDOWN, FAILURE TO ACCURATELY TRANSFER, READ OR TRANSMIT INFORMATION, FAILURE TO UPDATE OR
      PROVIDE CORRECT INFORMATION, SYSTEM INCOMPATIBILITY OR PROVISION OF INCORRECT COMPATIBILITY INFORMATION OR
      BREACHES IN SYSTEM SECURITY, OR (C) ANY DAMAGES THAT IN THE AGGREGATE EXCEED THE TOTAL FEES PAID OR PAYABLE BY
      CUSTOMER FOR THE SERVICE THAT IS OR THE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF THE CLAIM DURING THE TWELVE
      (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT WHICH GIVES RISE TO SUCH DAMAGES. THESE LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY
      WHETHER OR NOT A PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF
      ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.
    </p>
    <p><strong>8. Confidentiality.</strong></p>
    <p>
      8.1. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Definition</span>. Each party (the “<strong>Receiving Party</strong
      >”) understands that the other party (the “<strong>Disclosing Party</strong>”) may disclose business, technical or
      financial information relating to the Disclosing Party’s business that reasonably should be understood to be
      confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure (hereinafter referred to as
      the “<strong>Confidential Information</strong>” of the Disclosing Party). Pavrel’s Confidential Information
      includes non-public information regarding features, functionality, and performance of the Service. Customer’s
      Confidential Information includes the User Information and User Submissions. This Agreement and the information in
      all Orders will be deemed the Confidential Information of both parties. Notwithstanding the above, Confidential
      Information does not include information that (a) is or becomes generally available to the public without breach
      of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party; (b) was known to the Receiving Party prior to its disclosure by
      the Disclosing Party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party; (c) is received from a third
      party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party; or (d) was independently developed by the
      Receiving Party without use or reference to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.
    </p>
    <p>
      8.2. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Protection and Use of Confidential Information</span>. The Receiving
      Party will (a) protect the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information using the same degree of care used to
      protect its own confidential or proprietary information of like importance, but in any case using no less than a
      reasonable degree of care, (b) limit access to the Confidential Information to those employees, affiliates,
      subcontractors, agents, consultants, legal advisors, financial advisors, and contractors
      (“<strong>Representatives</strong>”) who need to know such information in connection with this Agreement and who
      are bound by confidentiality and non-use obligations just as protective of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential
      Information as the terms of this Agreement; (c) except as expressly set forth herein, make all commercially
      reasonable efforts not to disclose any of Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to any third parties without
      the Disclosing Party’s prior written consent; and (d) will not use the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information
      for any purpose other than to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement. Nothing above will prevent either
      party from sharing the terms of this Agreement or the name of the other party with prospective investors or
      acquirors; provided, however, that the foregoing persons or entities are bound to standard confidentiality
      obligations.
    </p>
    <p>
      8.3. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Compelled Access or Disclosure</span>. The Receiving Party may
      access or disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party if it is required by law; provided, however,
      that the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of the compelled access or disclosure (to the
      extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party
      wishes to contest the access or disclosure.
    </p>
    <p>
      8.4. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Feedback</span>. Customer may from time to time provide suggestions,
      comments, or other feedback with respect to the Service (“<strong>Feedback</strong>”). For the avoidance of doubt,
      Feedback will only refer to suggestions, comments or other feedback provided to Pavrel specifically regarding the
      Service and will not include User Information or User Submissions. Pavrel may want to incorporate Feedback into
      its Service and this clause provides Pavrel with the necessary license to do so. Customer hereby grant to Pavrel
      and Pavrel’s assigns a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, fully transferable and sublicensable right
      and license, if any, to use, disclose, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, display, and
      otherwise distribute and exploit any Feedback as Pavrel sees fit, entirely without obligation or restriction of
      any kind, except that Pavrel will not identify Customer as the provider of such Feedback.
    </p>
    <p><strong>9. Data.</strong></p>
    <p>
      9.1. <span style="text-decoration: underline">User Information</span>. Customer and its Users are required to
      provide information such as name, email address, username, IP address, browser, and operating system. (“<strong
        >User Information</strong
      >”) upon logging into the Service in order to access the Service. Customer grants Pavrel and its subcontractors
      the right to store, process and retrieve the User Information in connection with Customer’s use of the Service.
      Customer represents and warrants that it has obtained all necessary rights to transfer User Information to Pavrel
      and to process the User Information as contemplated by this Agreement. Customer is responsible for all User
      Information. Accordingly, Customer is responsible for all resulting liability if usernames, passwords, tokens, or
      keys in Customer’s possession are used by any party not authorized to do so. Customer (on behalf of its Users)
      grants Pavrel the right to access, use, process, copy, distribute (to Users), perform (for Users), export (to
      Users) and display (for Users) User Information, only as reasonably necessary (a) to provide the Service to
      Customer (including the transfer of User Information to Pavrel); (b) to prevent or address service, security,
      support, or technical issues; (c) as required by law; and (d) as expressly permitted in writing by Customer.
    </p>
    <p>
      9.2. <span style="text-decoration: underline">User Submissions</span>. Customer grants Pavrel and its
      subcontractors a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, paid-up, transferable right and license to use, process,
      and display (to Users) User Submissions for the sole purpose of providing the Service to Customer. Except for the
      limited rights and licenses granted in this Agreement, Customer will own all right, title and interest in and to
      the User Submissions and there are no implied licenses under this Agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      9.3. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Service Data</span>. As Customer (including its Users) interacts
      with the Service the Service collects data pertaining to the performance of the Service and measures of the
      operation of the Service (“<strong>Service Data</strong>”). Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary herein,
      provided that the Service Data is aggregated and anonymized, and no User Information, User Submissions, or any
      other personal identifying information of Customer is revealed to any third party, the parties agree that Pavrel
      is free to use the Service Data in any manner. Pavrel owns all right, title, and interest in and to such Service
      Data. For clarity, this section does not give Pavrel the right to identify Customer (including its Users) as the
      source of any Service Data.
    </p>
    <p>
      9.4. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Data Protection</span>.Pavrel has established and implemented
      reasonable information security practices regarding the protection of User Submissions and User Information
      (collectively “<strong>Customer Data</strong>”), including administrative, technical, and physical security
      processes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer is responsible for maintaining appropriate security, protection
      and backup of its hardware, software, systems, information, and Customer Data. Pavrel will, during the Term,
      process all Customer Data in accordance with Pavrel’s data protection agreement, a copy of which can be found at
      <a href="https://pavrel.com/dpa">pavrel.com/dpa</a>
